## Introduction
Hello, I'm James Bray, an Aerospace Engineering student at the University of Sheffield. 

This is my portfolio where I keep code for my projects, apps, and anything else I feel might be worth sharing. I teach myself different languages and use those to develop solutions which improves both my problem-solving and general software development skills. All of my code is open source and I encourage improvements and innovations.

I have other (non-software based) projects on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamesbray03), so please feel free to have a look at those.
